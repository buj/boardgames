The world contains 3 things: the previous world, the stack, and the
thing trie.

The stack contains: the stack below, the field trie, the return
location, whether the stack is minor or major, whether the stack is
a return point.

The thing trie is a trie, each of its nodes may contain a thing.

A thing consists of a field-bag trie.

A field-bag contains fields with the given name. Each field has its
priority. The field-bag knows the fields in order sorted by
priorities.
