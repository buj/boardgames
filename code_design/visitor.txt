Suppose A wants to use B, but doesn't know B's type. This can be solved
with the visitor pattern. However, if A expects B to be of specific
type, a more reasonable approach is casting B to that type. The visitor
is useful only if there are multiple viable types, and the behaviours
are different for each type. (Otherwise, the implementation for the
unexpected types is not important / empty.)
