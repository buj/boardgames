The game structures can be divided into three parts:

1. The physical components (the way they are connected and their
description) and the stack. These are all mutable, and the changes
must be accessible to the outside observer.

2. The logic of the game. This is immutable. It covers all the
functions, procedures, states, even those that are located in fields
of objects. (The object's possession of these fields is mutable, but
the description of the fields themselves is not. The field wraps the
contents, but it isn't equivalent to them.)

3. The history of the game. This covers only the first part: the objects
and the stack. The flow of the game and the computations outside of the
stack are inaccessible.
