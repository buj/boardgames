Commands are the most elementary of all executables. They are used
inside blocks of code. They can be divided into three groups:

1. Control flow statements: if, for_each, while.

2. State modifiers: procedure and state calls, variable assignment,
  object attaching and detaching, object or field revealing, object
  gaining and losing fields, return statement, ...

3. Special commands: end_turn.

Notes for programming:

  Control flow statements can be implemented directly, because they
are transparent and they have no direct impact
on the world. When implementing state modifiers, keep in mind that
the world must be a persistent data structure.
  Each command should have a method "execute()". Alternatively,
a visitor will do the execution for us. The execution must return
an empty "Value" object.
  Procedure and state calls can be called from a certain scope. That's
how things from inside objects are called. Therefore, they must have
a scope specified in addition to the name and arguments.
