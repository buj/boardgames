A function consists of the following:

0. Function ID.

1. Name, which is used when calling the function. There cannot be
  two functions in the same scope with the same name.

2. Argument list, which is used to provide values to names. Formally,
  it is a name list, which is used during function call to construct
  a name-value list. (There are no variable types, that is, the
  language is dynamically typed. That's also the reason why there is
  no return type specified.)

3. Block of code. This contains the commands that will be executed when
  the function is called. This part can be merged with the previous part
  to create a "block of code with references".
