A procedure is similar to a function. It has all the things that
a function contains: ID, name, argument list, block of code. In
addition to that, it can have one of the following flags set:

- Black-box. A black-box procedure is communicated differently to
  clients. Instead of providing values that are nondeterministic
  from the clients' perspective, it instead provides all the visible
  effects that happen. That means that the flow inside the procedure
  is hidden, and information can be hidden this way.

- Atomic. An atomic procedure cannot be interrupted in the middle of
  execution by triggered effects. The triggered effects are put onto
  a reserve stack, and only when the atomic procedure finishes are
  they put onto the stack.

Summary: ID, name, argument list, block of code, flags.
