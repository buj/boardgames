Things inside the bubble have all their fields revealed to all players,
and behave as if they had those fields.

Things outside of the bubble do not have to have their
fields revealed to all players. Only a select few
can see them, which means that they know of their existence and of
their value. Such things behave as if they didn't have these
fields.

This enforces that everything that has direct impact on the game
must be visible to all players.

The basic unit that can be inside/outside the bubble is a
field itself, not an object. Note that revealing all fields of an
object doesn't provide the same information as revealing the object
itself, because in the former, there is no guarantee that there are
no further fields. (Revealing an object reveals ALL its fields.)
