Triggers implement the functionality necessary to implement stuff
like this:

- Whenever an opponent draws a card, you draw 2 cards.
- Whenever a creature you control dies, target opponent loses 1 life
  and you gain 1 life.
- When this creature dies, each player discards a card.
...

They are composed of a condition, and a body. At each step of execution,
it is checked whether the originator of the trigger is still in the
game. If yes, the condition is checked. If we pass all the checks,
we execute the body of the trigger.

One way to implement it is this: we remember a list of all triggers
that are still active. At each step, we check all the triggers.
The triggers that fail the "originator existence" test are removed
from the list. The triggers that pass both tests are executed in some
order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: how do we determine the order of execution of multiple
triggers? (There is no problem if there is only 1 trigger, or all
triggers are mutually commutative. That's not all the cases, though.)
