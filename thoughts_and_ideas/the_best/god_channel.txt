At the beginning, there is nothing in the universe. Then, the game
engine starts creating things. Suppose that the order in which the
things are created is fixed (the objects can still be hidden).
Then, we can deduce which object is which just by the time the object
was created, and no amount of shuffling will erase this information,
because we can see everything in the universe. (It is a
"god information channel" from our perspective.)

This is a problem. It appears there can be no hidden information at all,
even though the system for hiding information exists. There is a way
around it, but it is far away from an optimal solution:
  We create a set of numbers from 1 to N, then randomly order it into a
list, and for each element of the list (in the order from the
beginning), we call a function "create(X)" which creates an object
based on the value of X. All this is inside a black-box so that the
information doesn't leak to the clients.

Other possible ways to solve the problem:

1. Have the ability to force players "out of the room" during the game
setup, and when we are done with the setup, invite them back in. This
would have to be done whenever we wanted to introduce new hidden
information into the game.

2. Have the ability to shuffle a set of cards IDs. This is only done
on the server's side, because otherwise if we were to communicate the
permutation to the clients, there would be no point in doing this.
This is a dangerous tool and has to be used carefully, because if
the objects are not all identical, it can lead to confusion instead
of hidden information. (It really isn't clear what "identical" means.)
