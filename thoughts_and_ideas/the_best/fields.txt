How do we implement abilities such as these:

- All creatures you control have flying.
- Until end of turn, target creature gains "When this creature dies,
  it deals 5 damage to target player."
- Gain control of target creature for as long as you have a card in
  your hand.
- Other creatures you control get +2/+2.
...

They are all abilities that are saying "these things have these
abilities". Fields, which correspond to abilities, should therefore
be able to specify not only the effect, but also who obtains the
effect, what conditions must be satisfied in order for him to obtain
it. The effect also doesn't have to be a new one, it can instead modify
an existing effect or property of the object (like power, toughness,
...).
