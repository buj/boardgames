Think of the visualizer/human client as an AI -- it is receiving
exactly the same data from the server as an AI player would receive,
and it is sending the same data too (because it essentially is an
AI player except for the "AI" part).

The visualizer must be able to determine the current physical and
logical state of the game, and it must be able to visualize the flow
of the game. These are all the things that the human player needs to
make an informed decision (or to enjoy playing the game).
