Before dealing with high-level constructs, we should create a low-level
sublayer that will take care of all the issues of communication between
client and server, hidden information, history, memoization, and
dependencies between variables.

Maybe we could drop dependencies between variables, because there are
issues with recursion (and we probably want recursion). In such a case,
we would also have to drop memoization (which depends on dependency
system to know when a new value has to be computed).
