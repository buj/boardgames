Black-box function: a function whose flow is not communicated to the
client, but only its visible effects are communicated. This enables
the server to hide the values of some variables from the client.

White-box function: a function whose calls and flow are always
communicated to the client, even when called from inside a black-box
function. This means that a white-box function can always be responded
to, regardless of from where it was called.
  A player can be asked to provide a value only inside a white-box
function. Otherwise, that player would have no clue what to provide
and how it would be used when asked from inside a black-box function
(or from inside a function that was called by a black-box).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Essentially, a function is a named block of code. So almost all things
applicable to functions should be applicable to arbitrary blocks
of code -- black-box, white-box, substituted values for variables
(function arguments), ...

The only things special about functions are:

1. They are named, so they can be wrapped with wrappers, can be
responded to, and can be called, unlike blocks of code (which are
anonymous). They may also return values.

2. Functions defined inside classes have a set of default, always
accessible variables. They can also be constant, which means they
do not modify these class instance variables.

3. A function returning non-void is a pure function. If any
state-changing effects are used inside such a function, these are
reverted upon returning from it. (This is useful in making things like:
"What would be this value if this has happened? Would this be true? ...")
