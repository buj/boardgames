Sometimes, not only object data itself is hidden (like what cards
you have in hand), but also the way the objects are connected to each
other is hidden. 

For example:

- In the game Battleships, you do not know the location of your
opponent's ships. (Although there are other problems with implementing
this game, like: each ship covers not one cell, but multiple cells,
which can not be modeled with a simple attachment.)

- In the game Dungeon Lords with the Festival expansion, during the
festival, each player first hides all his imps, and then reveals
a subset of them.
